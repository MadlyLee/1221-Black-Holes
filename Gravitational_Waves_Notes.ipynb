        "  Issac Newton views space as static, following Euclidian rules.\n",
        "  Einstein believed that space is curved and changable. It can shrink and expand. Space can have moving \"ripples\" called gravitational waves.\n",

        "Black holes have the strongest gravity... suppose you make two black holes, remnants of binary stars. They eventually lose orbital momentum.\n",
        "They will eventually stop spinning, giving away energy, until they merge... when the orbital separation becomes twice the radius of the black hole.\n",
        "V = sqrt(GM/2r) = c (speed of light) -> r = 3.0 km\n",
        "\n",
        "As the black holes orbit, they send out gravitational waves into space.\n",

        "Lasers. Laser light is cohere: all waves have the same wavelength and the same phase.\n",
        "Laser light is sent down both arms of LIGO, reflected from mirrors at the ends, and brought together by a \"beam splitter.\"\n",
        "Sends in opposite phases to be null... but very slightly different due to gravitational waves. You will get a weak, detetable differences.\n",

        "We have two! Simultaneous detection. Look for signals seen at both locations.\n",
        "Also, look for characteristic shapes from the signal of two black holes. As the gravitational waves escape, they carry away energy. As a result, the black holes spiral in toward each other, orbiting fast and faster.\n",
